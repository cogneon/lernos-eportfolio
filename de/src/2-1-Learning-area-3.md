**A) Present possible further development of the topic** | (approx. 15 Minuten)

In this week you should complete your subject / topic of interest in the
first glance and reach a finalized first version for you. You can use
the time together in the circle to present the last developments or
adjustments based on the received feedback to the others. You dont
have to do that this time but you can also ask the others to look at
your final version during the week. Surely some of you will have an idea
that might be discussed in the circle.

*If applicable ask yourself the following question: What do you think are the basic characteristics of a good ePortfolio and what basic functionalities should it have? (see also Basics)*

**B) Have a look on the curated ePortfolio tool list and exchange possible experiences with a tool** | (approx. 25 minutes)

Have a look at the following list of recommendations and exchange ideas
about who already knows which tool or has first experiences with it.

Top 10 list of recommended ePortfolio tools by the guide authors (in any
order)

-   [Padlet](https://padlet.com/) -- simple, quick to set up pinboard
    with different pre-configured designs and formats. Very
    comfortable to use and to share and collaborative fillable. 3
    padlets are free per user. Simple tool, very popular also e.g. for
    schools.

-   [Mahara](https://mahara.de/) -- probably the most established
    ePortfolio tool, especially popular in schools and universities.
    Free for educational institutions up to 100 persons. Wide range of
    functions with portfolio (views, file collection, learning
    diaries), groups, forums, profile with learning goals and plans.

-   [Wordpress](https://de.wordpress.org/) -- One of the best known Open
    Source CMS systems which is used very successfully for weblogs and
    homepages. With many themes and add-ons. Good and comfortable to
    use.

-   [PebblePad](https://www.pebblepad.co.uk/) - commercial ePortfolio
    tool with extensive functionality, customizable templates and
    external app integrations

-   [OneNote](https://products.office.com/de-de/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) -
    Standard tool from Microsoft which can be licensed either freely
    (up to 5GB of data) or commercially via educational and business
    licenses. Very popular in school environments where it can already
    be used in digital lessons (cloud technology). Very flexible in
    use and is constantly being expanded and improved. Can be
    integrated into the Office 365 ecosystem.

-   [Connections](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_Connections) -
    Enterprise social networking platform from HCL (formerly provided
    by IBM) which promotes the transparent preparation and design of
    an ePortfolio via an internal community concept with blog, wiki
    and forum module

-   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) / [Xing](https://www.xing.com)
    as ePortfolio online profile tools with social networking focus to
    present yourself professionally and exchange information with
    other network members

-   [Twitter](https://twitter.com) as network-based microblogging tool
    to present short information and helpful links and to exchange
    with other followers via hashtags

-   Combined version of **OneNote** and **Connections** (internal
    company solution)

-   Combined version of **Wordpress**, **Twitter** and **LinkedIn / Xing** (external solution)

We especially recommend that you also think about possible tool
combinations. Because from a functional point of view they can offer the
most added value when creating and publishing your contributions.

**C) Distribution among the circle members (each one a tool for a closer look** | (approx. 20 Minuten)

Decide together who would like to take a closer look at
which tool in the course of the week. Choose one tool at a time and
think about the first criteria that would be especially important for
you to be able to give an assessment of the usability as an ePortfolio.
It might also make sense to split up according to the tool combinations
recommended at the end of the list and then collect the analyses by the
following week.

Basic kata for this week (approx. 1 hour):

Select an ePortfolio tool from the orientation list and experiment with
it until the following week, when you briefly introduce it to the
others. Below you will find a small tool template that you can use as an
orientation and fill out to present it to your Circle members next week.
Helpful criteria can be, for example, user-friendliness (usability) and
click paths, possible costs, suitable application scenarios as well as
dialogue and feedback possibilities.

Advanced kata (approx. 1 to 2 hours): Make a comparative
tool analysis for two of your favorite tools which you then present to
the others. This way you can make a better decision together.
As an orientation guide the preparation with regard to the [8C-model for collaborative technologies](http://bas.uni-koblenz.de/bas/publications_light.nsf/9419ff0c508bbae8c1257219004fef63/e71c2845ef894202c1257b45003f4934/$FILE/E2.0-collaborative-technologies.pdf)
from Susan Williams (2011) can serve here (see also the following PDF).

### Week 5 - Tool selection

**D) Presentation of the tool findings by means of a tool arena** | (approx. 25 minutes)

Present your findings about the tools you tried out to each
other today.

Our recommendation: Compare about five essential core functions of the
respective ePortfolio tool which you will compete with each other in
the circle. Which one offers which advantages? This will give you a
quick insight into the variety of tools.

**E) Exchange pros and cons in the group** | (approx. 25 minutes)

During the arena rounds please exchange which pros and cons
there are for which ePortfolio tool and keep them in a comparison (e.g.
as a table).

**F) Decide at the meeting or during the week which tool you want to use for your ePortfolio and why** | (approx 10 minutes)

Try to make a decision during the circle meeting as to
which ePortfolio tool or combination is most suitable for you and share
it with the others. If you are still a bit uncertain you can continue to
think about it during the week and use the recommendations of the others
to get clarity for yourself. In any case, please let the others know
which tool or combination you have chosen. This doesnt have to be
final but it is important for the beginning to be able to get started.

Basic kata for this week (approx. 1 hour):

Make the final decision for the ePortfolio tool or tool combination you
would like to use from now on. Search for valuable short explanatory
videos or links for using your favorite ePortfolio tool and share them
online. This can be a good further orientation and decision support for
those who are still undecided.

Advanced video kata (approx. 1 to 2 hours):

Create a short recommendation video for the others why you chose your
ePortfolio tool or your tool combination.
