### Week 0 - Getting to know each other

**A) Getting to know each other and intention of the circle** | (approx. 25 minutes)

Welcome to the ePortfolio Learning Circle Guide!

Great that you have gathered here and want to get to know this new
learning method! Please take enough time to introduce yourselves to
each other at the beginning. Who are you, what do you deal with in
your daily work and what are you particularly interested in or have
always wanted to learn more about?

**B) Discussion of the circle learning path over the 12 weeks** | (approx. 15 minutes)

To get a first overview of what to expect, please take a look at the
golden thread of this learning path. For this purpose we have prepared
the clear sketchnote in the beginning that shows you the seven
learning areas from bottom to top. Directly in front of each of the
learning areas also the structure of the content is shown (e.g. see
above). This should help you to find your way around and give you a
first basic understanding of the content.
In the following lines you can see an overview of the learning areas
again:

-   Learning area 1: Get to know circle members and ePortfolio method |
    Checking the level of knowledge among each other and looking at
    examples -- recognizing added value (2 weeks = 2w)

-   Learning area 2: State topic interest and define objectives for the
    ePortfolio (2w)

-   Learning area 3: Selection of ePortfolio tool and further
    development of the topic (2w)

-   Learning area 4: Creation and preparation of the first topic post
    and learning contemplation (2w)

-   Learning area 5: Networking and promotion of the ePortfolio within
    the community and obtain initial topic feedback and ideas (2w)

-   Learning area 6: Preparation of a topic agenda and publishing of
    further posts with potential exchange (2w)

-   Learning area 7: Encourage feedback and exchange about the
    ePortfolio topics as well as lessons learned (1w)

**C) Future exchange framework and expectations** | (approx. 20 minutes)

Please decide together when you want to meet for an hour each week and
if you would like to take a short break (at half time). You should
send yourself a first calendar invitation with the planning details
(especially the meeting link).

It is also important to clarify how you can come together in the best
way:

We recommend an online conference tool, such as Teams, Skype or Zoom
and if necessary a common online application to document your first
thoughts and ideas, such as OneNote, Etherpad or a Wiki. You are also
welcome to use our Circle Template, which we have put together for
you.

Surely it would be helpful if one of you takes over the moderation and
either someone else or all of you together make notes in the tool.
From our experience it works well if the moderation among the circle
members rotates weekly.

At the end of the week you can have a look at the content of week 1
and see what you can expect next. This can always be done as a
check-out every week to help you get a quick overview. The exercises,
so called katas, are mostly structured in a way that you can start or
discuss them together in the circle meeting and then complete them
over the week to take the results back into the next circle meeting.

And off we go with a short basic kata for the entry week
(about 1 hour effort):

Please think about what you expect from this Learning Circle and keep
it in mind. You can start this in the first presence meeting and bring
it with you until next week. Therefor we recommend that you take a
look at the basics of the ePortfolio learning method.

### Week 1 - Basic understanding

**D) Common basic understanding of the ePortfolio method and approaches** | (approx. 25 minutes)

Welcome to the first content week of the Circle Guide! Its great that
you want to stay tuned after last weeks sniffing around and that you
want to get to know the new learning method in detail! In order to get a
common basic understanding, please take a closer look at the basics
together again. Its best to go through them together - maybe one of
you has already browsed a bit during the last week and can give the
others a short summary of his or her findings? Of course, you can also
watch the videos individually afterwards or discuss them briefly to
avoid wasting too much time of your valuable hour.

**E) Present expectations and compare them with basic understanding** | (approx. 25 minutes)

Since you have also thought about what you expect from the Learning
Circle during the week, go through them one by one and present them. It
also addresses how this can fit in with the basic understanding of the
ePortfolio learning method.

**F) Indicate interest in the topic and identify initial similarities** | (approx. 10 min)

At the end, if it has not already been touched upon in the expectations,
think about the thematic direction you might want to take in the next
few weeks. This will then be your central object of exchange and
learning with the others.

Basic kata for this week (approx. 1 hour):

Describe your interests in the course of the week. This can be done in
bullet points for the time being and, if required, also include a small
link list or media collection (graphics, short explanatory videos).

Also take a look at 1 or 2 examples from the following list to get a first orientation on how an ePortfolio can look like for the upcoming week :

- [Dion Hinchcliffe](https://dionhinchcliffe.com/) - person-oriented
business portfolio
- [Sketchnoting](https://raeuberleiterin.de/) and [Office 365](https://medium.com/@LuiseFreese) - topic-oriented portfolios from
Luise Freese
- [Petra Schubert](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Petra_Schubert)
and [Susan Williams](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susan_Williams14) -
network-oriented academic portfolios on ResearchGate
- [Sebastian Thomas](http://sebastian-thomas.de/) - person-oriented
business portfolio (German language only = Glonly)
- [Elearning20.de](http://www.elearning2null.de/) - topic-oriented
Co-Portfolio of Thomas Bernhardt and Marcel Kirchner (Glonly)
- [Harald Schirmer](https://harald-schirmer.de/) - combined person and
topic portfolio (Glonly)
- [VUCARockers](https://harald-schirmer.de/vucarockers-members/) - a
growing ePortfolio community from Harald for designers of the future
(Glonly)

Recommended advanced kata for the week (approx. 1.5 hours):

Search for examples of ePortfolios in the web (e.g. thematic blogs or
podcasts) that you find exciting and bring them with you to the next
circle meeting. Also explain why you think they might fit in well with
the basic understanding of an ePortfolio.

Optional video kata: Present your favorite ePortfolio in a short video - this can include:

Who runs the ePortfolio and which topics does it deal with?

For a quick start into video production you can have a short look into
this two microlearnings:
