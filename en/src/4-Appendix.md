## Credits

During the process of creating this circle guide there were a number of
loyal companions who were always there to help and advise us.

Therefore we would like to thank all of them once again very much:

1.  to the members of the initial lernOS circle from which this guide
    was developed for the intensive, productive and open exchange -
    that is Alfred, Helmut, Herta, Judith, Marcel and Stefan,

2.  to our sketch artist Katrin for the great enrichment of this guide
    with her illustrations and her voluntary work,

3.  to Simon for the lernOS idea that came from his pen and the support
    and feedback in technical and organizational questions,

4.  to the krasseherde resp. the Corporate Learning and lernOS
    community for the great, valuable peer reviews to refine the
    guide,

5.  and of course to our partners and families for the considerate
    support of this mostly voluntary / honorary work beside the daily
    business!
