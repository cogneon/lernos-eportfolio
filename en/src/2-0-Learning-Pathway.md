# Learning pathway
**First of all a brief outline of the general conditions in this learning circle:**

-   Time frame: 13 weeks, if necessary with a break (1 x per week circle
    meeting + self-directed learning)

-   Week 0 for a common introduction (= try it out) and afterwards

-   12 weeks for interactive exchange about the methods and contents of
    the topics

    -   Exchange (1 hour together via online presence meeting) and
        so-called Katas (= exercises)

    -   Workload Basic 2 hours per week for beginners

    -   Workload Deepening +2 hours per week for special interested advanced learners

    -   The katas of the respective week are exercises with the
        recommendation to work through them during the week. They
        prepare you well for the exchange in the following week
        (flipped circle).
