### Week 2 - Objectives

**A) Brief presentation of ePortfolio examples you have brought with you** | (approx. 25 minutes)

Welcome to the second content week! After you were able to gain a basic
understanding of the ePortfolio learning method last week and determined
a rough interest in the topic you will deepen this together today.
Please take a closer look at some examples of ePortfolios and introduce
them to each other in a circle. Pay special attention to similarities or
differences between the examples. You are welcome to write down a short
list of criteria that are recurring in the examples or that are very
individual to give you further orientation.

**B) Limit the possible topic interest for the ePortfolio and clarify motivation (Why?)** | (approx. 25 minutes)

Now please introduce each other your topic of interest about which you
would like to build your ePortfolio and why it is so exciting or
relevant for you. We would also like you to give your first feedback on
this.

**C) Define the objective(s) of the ePortfolio and whom I want to reach (target group(s))** | (approx. 10 minutes)

At the end of the session think about a first possible objective for the
ePortfolio and whom you want to reach first. Of course this may change
or expand over time.

Basic kata for this week (approx. 1 hour): Out of the
current state please formulate your detailed ePortfolio topic of
interest / subject, the main target group and a central goal of the
ePortfolio.

Example for orientation: "I would like to create an environment in
which I can develop and document my personal learning steps on the topic
of artificial intelligence and make them available to the community.
Above all, I would like to inspire other interested parties for this
field of interest and, if possible, enter into an exchange with
experts"

Advanced kata (approx. 1 hour): Formulate in-depth learning
goals or sub-goals and carry out a small target group analysis in order
to be able to address different groups more effectively if necessary.

If applicable assistance with target group analysis and formulation
of learning objectives - Formulating core questions

### Week 3 - Structuring

**D) Present the topic interest, motivation, objective(s) and target group(s) to each other** | (approx. 20 minutes)

This week you are about to complete all basic, content related
requirements for the start of the ePortfolio. So this is the first
important milestone before we start selecting the suitable online tool
and the first release. Today take turns introducing your topics of
interest / subjects to the circle and describe the target group and
goal(s) you want to reach with your ePortfolio.

**E) Taking and giving feedback** | (approx. 20 minutes)

For the others in the circle it is important to listen proactively to
the presenter and to give constructive feedback. Ideally, this feedback
should be documented immediately and appropriately so that it can be
used for the fine-tuning.

**F) How do I prospectively structure my possible weekly activities in my ePortfolio?** | (approx. 20 minutes)

Finally think about together in the circle whether and how you can bring
a certain regularity towards the management of an ePortfolio. Here, for
example, it makes sense to think about the frequency with which
contributions are planned, created and published, which formats you want
to try out, whether you want to create a so-called contribution backlog
(list of possible content that can be considered for contributions) and
how this can look like.

Basic kata for this week (about 1 hour):

Based on the feedback received from the others develop your topic of
interest / subject further and refine the description of the
objectives.

Advanced kata "Having the end in mind" (approx. 1 hour)

Think about how the concrete end result after the 12 weeks of the circle
might look like? Sketch it out briefly, even if there is only a vague
picture of this result. Use this image in the coming weeks to refine,
add and change it. That way you can better reflect later on where you
are and what you still want to achieve.

Video kata (approx. 1 hour):

Create a small video podcast sequence in which you describe the topic
interest and the objectives of the ePortfolio in order to arouse the
interest of your target group later.
