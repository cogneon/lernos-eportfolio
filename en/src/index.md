# Introduction
When six of us started our first lernOS Circle in September 2019, it was
not yet clear where this learning journey would lead us finally. But we
were aware that we wanted to connect this experiment with something that
could give something back to others who would try it after us.

Basically each of us had his own topic that he pursued during the circle
time. Nevertheless, the shared experience of supporting each other and
exchanging information online enabled us to make good progress on all of
our topics.

Therefore the decision was made relatively quickly to continue with
three of us after the Circle and to create two own guides (Circle
Guides), which should enable others to gain these experiences themselves
through various innovative learning methods. So in the end one of these
two guides was created and we hope that it can accompany you well on
your learning journey.

**Central objectives of this ePortfolio Learning Guide**

This Circle Guide would like to show you a learning method with which
you can continue your education in an exciting future topic and exchange
and network with other learners.

You will be able to learn a basic and overview knowledge of the
ePortfolio method and Social Software.

At the same time you will build or further develop your own ePortfolio
with a suitable software and work out a detailed understanding of an
exciting topic with others.

We are already looking forward to your field reports and wish you a lot
of fun!
