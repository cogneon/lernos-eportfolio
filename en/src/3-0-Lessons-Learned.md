# Lessons learned

Here you can document your experiences as a separate
reflection area during the 12 weeks of the learning circle:

What were our experiences in creating the Circle Guide in a nutshell:

1.  Bring a long breath and patience in the creation.

2.  Gradually compile the contents of the weeks and katas, if possible
    in combination with a learning area or at least a guideline week
    with exercises.

3.  Pay attention to the golden thread and transition between exercises
    and following weeks and close gaps.

4.  Dont squeeze too much into a weekly session - less is more!

5.  Deliberately formulate katas as learning offers that promote
    motivation.
