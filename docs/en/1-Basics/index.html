<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Your notes for exchange:</p>
<p>When six of us started our first lernOS Circle in September 2019, it was
not yet clear where this learning journey would lead us finally. But we
were aware that we wanted to connect this experiment with something that
could give something back to others who would try it after us.</p>
<p>Basically each of us had his own topic that he pursued during the circle
time. Nevertheless, the shared experience of supporting each other and
exchanging information online enabled us to make good progress on all of
our topics.</p>
<p>Therefore the decision was made relatively quickly to continue with
three of us after the Circle and to create two own guides (Circle
Guides), which should enable others to gain these experiences themselves
through various innovative learning methods. So in the end one of these
two guides was created and we hope that it can accompany you well on
your learning journey.</p>
<p><strong>Central objectives of this ePortfolio Learning Guide</strong></p>
<p>This Circle Guide would like to show you a learning method with which
you can continue your education in an exciting future topic and exchange
and network with other learners.</p>
<p>You will be able to learn a basic and overview knowledge of the
ePortfolio method and Social Software.</p>
<p>At the same time you will build or further develop your own ePortfolio
with a suitable software and work out a detailed understanding of an
exciting topic with others.</p>
<p>We are already looking forward to your field reports and wish you a lot
of fun!</p>
<p>Basics</p>
<p>Your notes for exchange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Basics for the ePortfolio Learning Circle Guide</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning:\
If you are thinking about doing this Circle, you might want to have a
look at the following basics that we have put together for you:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What is actually behind the idea of an ePortfolio and what added</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>value can it offer?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are the components of an ePortfolio?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the management of an ePortfolio work?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does it mean to reflect with an ePortfolio?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the ePortfolio learning method we would like you to work
together in a circle on an exciting topic of your choice. You can
builc up an expertise that is visible online. It also gives you the
opportunity to network with others on this topic and build up a new
community of practice or join one. But now we will take a closer look
at the basics at first.</p>
<p><strong>1. What is actually behind the idea of an ePortfolio and what added
value can it offer?</strong></p>
<p>The portfolio method originally comes from the artistic field, in
which works made with skill (= artifacts) are put together in a folder
(portare = carry and folio = piece of paper in Latin). In addition,
one discusses the contents of this portfolio with others in order to
be able to develop further in the process and later even apply for a
job. This was transferred to electronic use with the advent of digital
media and the Internet. This also opens up more possibilities for
designing an ePortfolio.</p>
<p>As a further introduction we would like to recommend a small [online
tutorial]{.underline} which Marcel prepared in 2009 on this topic:

briefly and concisely as a hybrid form of online learning using
various social software. On the one hand this software serves to
transparently present oneself as a person with one\'s competencies and
to network with others (= social networking). On the other hand it is
used in combination with an appealing way of documenting the learning
process and results using digital media (= social publishing). What
has been learned is reflected in the process and specifically put up
for discussion (see Bernhardt / Kirchner 2007: 82 f. &amp; Kirchner 2015:
32 f.).</p>

<p>Little scientific exkursion (optional):</p>
<p>For those who would like to know it in more detail the following
classification is recommended (quoted from Kirchner 2015: 32ff. and
translated corresponding into English):</p>
<p>The original classification in the German-speaking countries comes
from the Salzburg Research Society \"EduMedia\":</p>
<p><em>\"E-portfolio is a digital collection of \'works made with skill\' (=
lat. artefacts) of a person who wants to document and illustrate the
product (learning outcomes) and the process (learning pathway/growth)
of his or her competence development in a certain period of time and
for certain purposes. The person concerned has made the selection of
artefacts independently and organised them in relation to the learning
objective. He/she, as the owner, has complete control over who, when
and how much information from the portfolio can be viewed.\"
(Hornung-Prähauser et al. 2007: 14 and Hilzensauer/Hornung-Prähauser
2006:4)</em>\
<em>(-> see also <a href="https://www.e-teaching.org/lehrszenarien/pruefung/pruefungsform/eportfolio">similar classification of
terms</a>
on e-teaching.org - German language only)</em></p>
<p>According to this classification the product and process were always
in the foreground at first but the feedback loop was neglected and the
competencies required for this were only indicated. In addition,
metaphorically speaking, one also speaks of a \"showcase of one\'s own
learning\" (Bräuer 2000: 22, quoted after Brunner et al. 2008: 35 as
well as Bauer/Baumgartner 2012). This is at least the [technological,
rather tool-oriented perspective]{.underline}.</p>
<p>From a [pedagogical-didactic perspective]{.underline}, however, it is
classified more as a (didactic) method of independent and
competence-based learning and ist application of which is supported by
various processes (including selection, reflection and presentation)
with its own objectives and planning and can even go as far as a
holistic institutionally controlled pedagogical concept. In the past
this has led to an increasing confusion of terms.</p>
<p>Therefore the attempt was made to define an integrating view as a
method and to link it to social software:</p>
<p><strong><em>\"According to this a social software portfolio is a specific form
of web-based self-presentation via an e-portfolio. The digital
processing of the artefacts offers the owner additional media options
for presenting learning products (especially in the form of audio and
video). By means of social software and especially the use of weblogs
such a portfolio also enables the owner to continuously reflect his
personal development of (media) skills and thus encourages reflection
in the self-directed connective learning process. This is particularly
supported by offering visitors the opportunity to provide feedback on
the content to the owner which in the case of e-portfolio blogs is
expressed primarily through the comment function or mutual
linking\"</em>.</strong> (quotef from Kirchner 2015: 36)</p>
<p><strong>2. What are the components of an ePortfolio?</strong></p>
<p>Here there is a wealth of possibilities and tools that can be used in
different ways. The following is a recommendation based on our
previous experience.</p>
<p>Everyone of us already uses different online tools to create content
on the web even if it\'s only to write an e-mail in a small circle or
to design a public website. This can be seen as a portal or gateway to
the Internet. With the help of this personal learning portal the
portfolio method can be applied directly, e.g. by having your own blog
and using a social network such as LinkedIn or Twitter to provide and
distribute your content (= artefacts).</p>
<p>In a broader sense content is generated through processes of setting
goals, collecting, selecting, linking and reflecting and finally
prepared for presentation, dissemination and possible evaluation (see
Kirchner 2015: 57 with reference to Hilzensauer, Hornung-Prähauser
2006: 5 or Hornung-Prähauser et al. 2007: 15). In the narrower sense
relevant content is taken up as a kind of an \"eye\" into the web and
published in a suitable manner via a \"showcase\", e.g. as blog
entries and tweets (see Kirchner 2015: 57 with reference to Bräuer
2000: 22 and Baumgartner / Bauer 2013).</p>
<p>The following infographic visually summarizes these processes:\</p>

<em>According to a slightly adapted model of self-directed connective
learning with e-portfolio blogs (Kirchner 2015: 58, Figure 11) as a
further development following Bernhardt / Kirchner 2007: 89 and with
reference to Hilzensauer, Hornung-Prähauser 2006: 5</em></p>
<p><strong>3. How does the management of an ePortfolio work?</strong></p>
<p>When using an ePortfolio and applying the associated method the
following [processes]{.underline} are essentially carried out which
have already been briefly mentioned above (see Hornung-Prähauser et
al. 2007: 15):</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setting goals</strong> to clarify the procedure and framework conditions</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>for managing the ePortfolio.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collecting, selecting and linking</strong> the contents in order to</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>document the competence development in the learning process.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reflecting</strong> in the ePortfolio in order to critically question</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>one\'s own performance and analyze the learning goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presenting and passing</strong> on the results to third parties in order</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>to make the competence development visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assessing and evaluating</strong> the ePortfolio in order to be able to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>assess the competence development holistically (optional).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4. What does it mean to reflect with an ePortfolio?</strong></p>
<p>Therefor we recommend [the first two minutes]{.underline} of Marcel\'s
second online tutorial:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h4Q4_YEFKU">ePortfolios in use - part

<p>*As the native language is German please activate subtitles and
choose English via the gear setting next to it:</p>

ouTub " src="../images/image3.png" />{width="3.075in"
height="1.1166666666666667in"}</p>
<p>Typical questions for orientation which you should ask yourself again
and again for reflection and which should be recorded as answers in
the ePortfolio are:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>\"What have I learned so far?\"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\"Where do I stand today?\"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\"What should be my next steps?\"</p>
</li>
</ul>

learning with ePortfolios and you can continue on your learning path.</p>

</strong>[A) Getting to know each other and intention of the
circle]{.underline} | (approx. 25 minutes)\
Welcome to the ePortfolio Learning Circle Guide!</p>
<p>Great that you have gathered here and want to get to know this new
learning method! Please take enough time to introduce yourselves to
each other at the beginning. Who are you, what do you deal with in
your daily work and what are you particularly interested in or have
always wanted to learn more about?</p>
<p>[B) Discussion of the circle learning path over the 12
weeks]{.underline} | (approx. 15 minutes)\
To get a first overview of what to expect, please take a look at the
golden thread of this learning path. For this purpose we have prepared
the clear sketchnote in the beginning that shows you the seven
learning areas from bottom to top. Directly in front of each of the
learning areas also the structure of the content is shown (e.g. see
above). This should help you to find your way around and give you a
first basic understanding of the content.\
In the following lines you can see an overview of the learning areas
again:\
</p>

<p>[C) Future exchange framework and expectations]{.underline} |
(approx. 20 minutes)\
Please decide together when you want to meet for an hour each week and
if you would like to take a short break (at half time). You should
send yourself a first calendar invitation with the planning details
(especially the meeting link).</p>
<p>It is also important to clarify how you can come together in the best
way:\
We recommend an online conference tool, such as Teams, Skype or Zoom
and if necessary a common online application to document your first
thoughts and ideas, such as OneNote, Etherpad or a Wiki. You are also
welcome to use our Circle Template, which we have put together for
you.</p>
<p>Surely it would be helpful if one of you takes over the moderation and
either someone else or all of you together make notes in the tool.
From our experience it works well if the moderation among the circle
members rotates weekly.</p>
<p>At the end of the week you can have a look at the content of week 1
and see what you can expect next. This can always be done as a
check-out every week to help you get a quick overview. The exercises,
so called katas, are mostly structured in a way that you can start or
discuss them together in the circle meeting and then complete them
over the week to take the results back into the next circle meeting.</p>
<p>And off we go with a short [basic kata]{.underline} for the entry week
(about 1 hour effort):\
Please think about what you expect from this Learning Circle and keep
it in mind. You can start this in the first presence meeting and bring
it with you until next week. Therefor we recommend that you take a
look at the basics of the ePortfolio learning method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your notes for exchange:</p>
<p>Week 1 - Basic understanding</p>
<p>[D) Common basic understanding of the ePortfolio method and
approaches]{.underline} | (approx. 25 minutes)\
Welcome to the first content week of the Circle Guide! It\'s great that
you want to stay tuned after last week\'s sniffing around and that you
want to get to know the new learning method in detail! In order to get a
common basic understanding, please take a closer look at the basics
together again. It\'s best to go through them together - maybe one of
you has already browsed a bit during the last week and can give the
others a short summary of his or her findings? Of course, you can also
watch the videos individually afterwards or discuss them briefly to
avoid wasting too much time of your valuable hour.</p>
<p>[E) Present expectations and compare them with basic
understanding]{.underline} | (approx. 25 minutes)</p>
<p>Since you have also thought about what you expect from the Learning
Circle during the week, go through them one by one and present them. It
also addresses how this can fit in with the basic understanding of the
ePortfolio learning method.</p>
<p>[F) Indicate interest in the topic and identify initial similarities |
(approx. 10 min)]{.underline}</p>
<p>At the end, if it has not already been touched upon in the expectations,
think about the thematic direction you might want to take in the next
few weeks. This will then be your central object of exchange and
learning with the others.</p>
<p>[Basic kata]{.underline} for this week (approx. 1 hour):\
Describe your interests in the course of the week. This can be done in
bullet points for the time being and, if required, also include a small
link list or media collection (graphics, short explanatory videos).\
\
Also take a look at [1 or 2 examples]{.underline} from the following
list to get a first orientation on how an ePortfolio can look like for
the upcoming week :</p>

\
[Recommended advanced kata]{.underline} for the week (approx. 1.5
hours):\
Search for examples of ePortfolios in the web (e.g. thematic blogs or
podcasts) that you find exciting and bring them with you to the next
circle meeting. Also explain why you think they might fit in well with
the basic understanding of an ePortfolio.\
\
[Optional video kata:\
]{.underline}Present your favorite ePortfolio in a short video - this
can include:</p>
<p>Who runs the ePortfolio and which topics does it deal with?</p>

<p>[A) Brief presentation of ePortfolio examples you have brought with
you]{.underline} | (approx. 25 minutes)\
Welcome to the second content week! After you were able to gain a basic
understanding of the ePortfolio learning method last week and determined
a rough interest in the topic you will deepen this together today.
Please take a closer look at some examples of ePortfolios and introduce
them to each other in a circle. Pay special attention to similarities or
differences between the examples. You are welcome to write down a short
list of criteria that are recurring in the examples or that are very
individual to give you further orientation.\
\
[B) Limit the possible topic interest for the ePortfolio and clarify
motivation (Why?)]{.underline} | (approx. 25 minutes)\
Now please introduce each other your topic of interest about which you
would like to build your ePortfolio and why it is so exciting or
relevant for you. We would also like you to give your first feedback on
this.\
\
[C) Define the objective(s) of the ePortfolio and whom I want to reach
(target group(s))]{.underline} | (approx. 10 minutes)\
At the end of the session think about a first possible objective for the
ePortfolio and whom you want to reach first. Of course this may change
or expand over time.</p>
<p>[Basic kata]{.underline} for this week (approx. 1 hour): Out of the
current state please formulate your detailed ePortfolio topic of
interest / subject, the main target group and a central goal of the
ePortfolio.</p>
<p><em>Example for orientation: \"I would like to create an environment in
which I can develop and document my personal learning steps on the topic
of artificial intelligence and make them available to the community.
Above all, I would like to inspire other interested parties for this
field of interest and, if possible, enter into an exchange with
experts\".</em>[\
\
Advanced kata]{.underline} (approx. 1 hour): Formulate in-depth learning
goals or sub-goals and carry out a small target group analysis in order
to be able to address different groups more effectively if necessary.</p>
<p><em>-> If applicable assistance with target group analysis and formulation
of learning objectives -> Formulating core questions</em></p>
<p>Your notes for exchange:</p>
<p>Week 3 - Structuring</p>
<p>[D) Present the topic interest, motivation, objective(s) and target
group(s) to each other]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
This week you are about to complete all basic, content related
requirements for the start of the ePortfolio. So this is the first
important milestone before we start selecting the suitable online tool
and the first release. Today take turns introducing your topics of
interest / subjects to the circle and describe the target group and
goal(s) you want to reach with your ePortfolio.\
\
[E) Taking and giving feedback]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
For the others in the circle it is important to listen proactively to
the presenter and to give constructive feedback. Ideally, this feedback
should be documented immediately and appropriately so that it can be
used for the fine-tuning.<em>\
\
</em>[F) How do I prospectively structure my possible weekly activities in
my ePortfolio?]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
Finally think about together in the circle whether and how you can bring
a certain regularity towards the management of an ePortfolio. Here, for
example, it makes sense to think about the frequency with which
contributions are planned, created and published, which formats you want
to try out, whether you want to create a so-called contribution backlog
(list of possible content that can be considered for contributions) and
how this can look like.</p>
<p>[Basic kata]{.underline} for this week (about 1 hour):</p>
<p>Based on the feedback received from the others develop your topic of
interest / subject further and refine the description of the
objectives.\</p>
<p>[Advanced kata]{.underline} \"Having the end in mind\" (approx. 1
Stunde)\
Think about how the concrete end result after the 12 weeks of the circle
might look like? Sketch it out briefly, even if there is only a vague
picture of this result. Use this image in the coming weeks to refine,
add and change it. That way you can better reflect later on where you
are and what you still want to achieve.</p>
<p>[Video kata]{.underline} (approx. 1 hour):\
Create a small video podcast sequence in which you describe the topic
interest and the objectives of the ePortfolio in order to arouse the
interest of your target group later.</p>

</em><strong>\
</strong>[A) Present possible further development of the topic]{.underline} |
(approx. 15 Minuten)\
In this week you should complete your subject / topic of interest in the
first glance and reach a finalized first version for you. You can use
the time together in the circle to present the last developments or
adjustments based on the received feedback to the others. You don\'t
have to do that this time but you can also ask the others to look at
your final version during the week. Surely some of you will have an idea
that might be discussed in the circle.</p>
<p><em>If applicable ask yourself the following question: What do you think
are the basic characteristics of a good ePortfolio and what basic
functionalities should it have? (see also Basics)\
\
</em>[B) Have a look on the curated ePortfolio tool list and exchange
possible experiences with a tool]{.underline} | (approx. 25 minutes)\</p>
<p>Have a look at the following list of recommendations and exchange ideas
about who already knows which tool or has first experiences with it.\</p>

    &gt;  </li>
</ul>
<p>We especially recommend that you also think about possible tool
combinations. Because from a functional point of view they can offer the
most added value when creating and publishing your contributions.</p>
<p>\
[C) Distribution among the circle members (each one a tool for a closer
look]{.underline} | (approx. 20 Minuten)[\
]{.underline}Decide together who would like to take a closer look at
which tool in the course of the week. Choose one tool at a time and
think about the first criteria that would be especially important for
you to be able to give an assessment of the usability as an ePortfolio.
It might also make sense to split up according to the tool combinations
recommended at the end of the list and then collect the analyses by the
following week.\</p>
<p>[Basic kata]{.underline} for this week (approx. 1 hour):\
Select an ePortfolio tool from the orientation list and experiment with
it until the following week, when you briefly introduce it to the
others. Below you will find a small tool template that you can use as an
orientation and fill out to present it to your Circle members next week.
Helpful criteria can be, for example, user-friendliness (usability) and
click paths, possible costs, suitable application scenarios as well as
dialogue and feedback possibilities.</p>

]{.underline}Try to make a decision during the circle meeting as to
which ePortfolio tool or combination is most suitable for you and share
it with the others. If you are still a bit uncertain you can continue to
think about it during the week and use the recommendations of the others
to get clarity for yourself. In any case, please let the others know
which tool or combination you have chosen. This doesn\'t have to be
final but it is important for the beginning to be able to get started.\
\
[Basic kata]{.underline} for this week (approx. 1 hour):\
Make the final decision for the ePortfolio tool or tool combination you
would like to use from now on. Search for valuable short explanatory
videos or links for using your favorite ePortfolio tool and share them
online. This can be a good further orientation and decision support for
those who are still undecided.\

<p>[\
A) Searching and reading of first sources (Seeking method)]{.underline}
| (approx. 20 minutes)</p>
<p>After the tool selection for ePortfolios in the past two weeks, the
focus is now back on content. In order to be able to create a first
article on a topic, relevant information and people have to be searched
for and discovered. Either information can be found automatically via
social media channels, RSS feeds or content aggregators with artificial
intelligence, like <a href="https://anderspink.com/">anderspink.com</a> or
<a href="https://refind.com/">refind.com</a>. Or you actively search and observe
yourself on content portals, in open knowledge resources - Open
Educational Resources (OER), on YouTube, in blogs or search engines and
social media channels. Exchange about possible concrete sources for your
first professional contribution for your created topic interest.</p>
<p>[B) Classification of the sources with short explanation (Sensemaking
method)]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)</p>
<p>How would you formulate a rationale for a good source?\
What are the basic criteria to be considered? Discuss this among
yourselves.</p>
<p>Below is a small orientation from us that can help with the discussion:</p>
<p>Criteria that speak for high quality content: :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The author is an expert in his/her field. You can find this out by
    &gt; following them on social media channels like Twitter or LinkedIn,
    &gt; researching their posts, looking at their publication history or
    &gt; analyzing personal blogs or video channels. Very good experts are
    &gt; also often invited to lectures and events or recommended by
    &gt; colleagues from the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contents quote sources and do not just reflect their own
    &gt; opinion. You can see this for example in links and references in
    &gt; texts or e.g. in the so-called \"shownotes\" of podcasts and links
    &gt; in YouTube videos. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Famous content providers such as publishing houses, portals or
    &gt; universities post or link to the content. The contents are linked,
    &gt; recommended and discussed by colleagues on social media channels
    &gt; and in blog posts and invite you to form an opinion and to get
    &gt; more closely involved with the author or the topic.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>There are basically not THE criteria to classify the quality of a
source. The perception of what is and what is not good quality content
depends strongly on your own personality and preferences. For example,
people who work in the natural sciences and are used to reading a lot
and processing the information read quickly and effectively, scientific
texts published by renowned universities and researchers feel more
relevant and valuable than, for example, a short explanatory video that
gets to the heart of exactly the same content in 5 minutes in an
animated way.</p>
<p>Therefore it is especially valuable to give your readers a short
personal assessment of why you consider the cited sources to be valuable
and relevant and what you yourself have learned while working with these
media.</p>
<p>This is also an ideal transition to the third point of today, the
learning reflection.</p>
<p>[C) Guidance on how a good learning reflection can be
processed]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
The main goal of an ePortfolio is to make your own learning and the
learning process visible. Of course you learn a lot by bringing together
different sources and content on your topic, preparing them, processing
them and then presenting them for discussion in the ePortfolio. But a
not inconsiderable part of learning takes place through your reflection
- i.e. thinking and observing how you learn (best) in which way, which
activities are most beneficial for you, how you make connections to your
existing knowledge. This deepens your knowledge, makes learning easier
for you and helps you to plan your learning process more effectively. At
the same time you show others how you learn. Therefore it is important
that you develop your ability to reflect on your learning with your
growing ePortfolio.</p>
<p>Share how you normally think about your learning and your learning
process and how you reflect on it. Is this more incidentally and
sporadic? Do you do this by telling others about your learning
experiences, do you write something down for yourself? Do you collect
ideas together and try out for yourself what would help you to reflect?</p>
<p>Here are a few useful questions from us to reflect on your learning
process:</p>
<p>In general:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you describe your own learning so far? How planned /</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>unplanned do you proceed? How effective do you rate your learning?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Which strategies and methods help you to learn in general, which do</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>not?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What is your ideal learning place, your ideal learning environment?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>What must be there / not be there so that you can learn well?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>How do you motivate yourself to learn?</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific (related to a \"learning unit\") - here the example of the
Circle and your ePortfolio:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What were your goals, what did you want to learn?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What did you learn? Where do you stand today? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where were you able to build on existing knowledge?\</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Where did new knowledge connections emerge?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are you satisfied with your learning progress?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What worked, what didn\'t? What were obstacles?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you strengthen what worked?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you overcome difficulties? Who can help you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What helped you to motivate yourself? What were your happy moments</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>while learning?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Where do you want to go? What are your next steps? </li>
</ul>
<p>[Basic kata]{.underline} in this week (approx. 1 hour):\
Back up your previously formulated topic interest with suitable sources
you have researched and prepare them together with the topic as a first
topic contribution which you will present to the circle in the following
week.\
\
[Advanced Kata]{.underline} in this week (approx. 1 hour):\
Reflect on how easy or challenging the source work is for you and record
it in a suitable way for discussion with others in the following week.</p>
<p>Your notes for exchange:</p>
<p>Week 7 - Publishing and reflection</p>
<p>[D) Short presentation of the entry level sources and integration into
the first topic article / posting]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
After you have dealt with three basic methods of content curation last
week and were able to learn about the core competence of ePortfolio
learning, the reflection, in the second part, this week will be about
deepening the insights you have gained. First introduce each other to a
suitable selection of sources you have investigated and how you have
prepared them for your topic contribution. Give each other a short
feedback on that.\</p>
<p>[E) Publication of the article / if applicable video microlearning
(Sharing method)]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
The core task this week is to actually make your first contribution
available to your audience via your ePortfolio. This can be done at a
self-chosen, suitable time during the week and can be published via
suitable media formats. An important approach is to describe a valuable
blog post or video in such a way that it will be noticed by your
followers or interested persons on social media channels like Twitter or
LinkedIn or even internal channels within the organization like
Connections. Your target group might be interested in answering the
following questions, which you can go through briefly together in the
circle:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How long does it take to work through the content?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are my personal experiences or insights from others?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why should my followers deal with the content?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For whom and why is this content particularly valuable (keyword:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>learning effect)?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What further questions have arisen from working through the content?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is my opinion of the content? What is my reasoning for this?</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>[F) Learning reflection round of the last two weeks]{.underline} |
(approx. 20 minutes)\
Pick up on your reflective talk from last week and think about how you
would like to personally reflect on your learning in the future. Start
with a few simple questions and reflections and refine it over the next
weeks. Create a reflection area in your portfolio and set a rhythm in
which you want to reflect on your learning. This can be published as a
reflective topic contribution or part of a contribution or even as a
separate page in the ePortfolio. The advantage of a separate page is the
clear separation between subject content and the overall reflection
process. Discuss which path you would like to take here.\
\
[Basic kata]{.underline} in this week (about 1 to 2 hours):\
In addition to the publication of the first topic contribution which
should take place now at the latest, please start thinking about what
other ideas for topic contributions you have in the upcoming weeks. You
should bring them along as a basis for discussion for the exchange in
the circle next week.</p>
<p>[Advanced video kata]{.underline} for reflection (about 1 hour):\
Present in a short video podcast episode what you have learned for
yourself in the last two weeks and up to this point in the circle about
the topic and the approach to your topic.</p>

<p>[A) Developing content ideas for further topic
contributions]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
After you have created your first topic contribution during the last two
weeks and perhaps already have a rough idea of how you want to proceed
with your topic, discuss it together today and try to refine the rough
plan. Which further aspects of your topic do you want to deepen in the
next weeks? Where do you want to leave room for new aspects of your
topic that you encounter in the course of your investigation? What do
you not want to work on more deeply for the moment? You can develop this
further in the course of this week and then exchange ideas either at the
meeting next week or in the ongoing process.\</p>
<p>[B) Taking and giving feedback]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
Now it is also a good time to practice getting feedback on your planning
from the others in the circle, to think about how and where it fits for
you and also how you can give helpful feedback to the others. To support
this you can work with different methods that bring a good structure
into the feedback and help you to cover several dimensions.</p>
<p>A good method for this is, for example, Twitter feedback: Present your
plan in the style of a Twitter message (or do it directly via Twitter)
and, if necessary, ask questions that you have to the other circle
participants. So max. 280 characters, hashtags, emojis etc. and the
others answer, retweet with comments, ask questions on your part and use
hashtags for the keywords again. Make several rounds about it and then a
small summary or sort the re-tweets and hashtags afterwards into
clusters, which very nicely show the main points, frequently mentioned
aspects or additions.\</p>
<p>[C) Distribute the first topic article via social media]{.underline} |
(approx. 20 minutes)\
We all live and work in communities and networks. With the Internet and
social media they have become larger, more geographically dispersed and
more international. The opportunities for establishing relationships,
accessing and sharing knowledge have also become much richer and more
diverse. ePortfolios thrive on this networking and exchange with others
- for example via social networks such as LinkedIn, Xing or Twitter.
That\'s why an important part of an ePortfolio is to build up its
community or contribute to relevant communities and then learn from the
comments and feedback from the network and further develop your own
ideas. A first step into a topic community is to exchange your topic
contributions with the other circle members in the respective social
networks. A good example of networking and appreciative exchange is the
<a href="https://workingoutloud.com/en/home">Working out Loud method</a>, which can
also be applied in learning circles.</p>
<p>So your ePortfolio lives and breathes especially through your networking
and building or entering a community. Up to now you have mainly
exchanged ideas with each other in the circle and if you have not yet
made your first contributions or artifacts available to a larger circle,
now it is a good time to do so. Discuss with each other how you want to
proceed and why you want to use which channel to further promote your
portfolio. Afterwards, please feel free to share your first feature
article about social media and other helpful channels.</p>
<p>[Basic kata]{.underline} in this week (about 1 hour):\
Publish your first ideas or a first rough topic plan as a second
contribution to the ePortfolio and search for suitable experts or other
contact points (e.g. institutions or organizations) for your topic on
the web who could potentially network and exchange information with you
in the future.</p>
<p>[Advanced kata]{.underline} in this week (about 1 hour):\
Leave a helpful comment in the ePortfolio of the others on their first
topic contribution and if applicable give additional tips on your own
experiences or links on the web.</p>
<p>Your notes for exchange:</p>
<p>Week 9 - Community building</p>
<p>[D) Provide current status on the topic]{.underline} | (approx. 20
minutes)\
After you have developed new topic ideas last week and evaluated them
with the others a first rough topic plan should now have been created
via the basic kata which covers different parts and facets of your theme
interest. Present this status in the circle and think about how you can
approach the two most important or the most pleasant next parts of the
plan.\
\
[E) Feedback round on who knows good contacts for the respective
topic]{.underline} | (approx. 25 minutes)\
Introduce your web experts and contact points to each other and find out
whether one or the other person in the circle already has a point of
reference or could even connect you to contacts that would be helpful.
Check together who it would be most worthwhile to get in contact with
and create a first common contact list which you can tackle in the
course of the week. The main goal is to consciously network and make
your ePortfolio known under the motto \"Make it easy\". Dare to try this
out with the circle members with whom you will strengthen each other\'s
backs!\
\
[F) Learning reflection on the current status]{.underline} | (approx.
15 minutes)\
At this point reflect together on what you have learned in the circle,
what was especially important and helpful for you, what you have already
been able to implement quite well, where things are not going so well
and where you can still use support (from the circle) or where you want
to deepen certain contents.\</p>
<p>Starting point for this can be for example a short summary of the most
important learnings of each circle member which you write on (analog or
digital) cards and then compare: What is the same? Where are you
different? At what point small accumulations have occurred? What do the
others have on the cards that you didn\'t think of yourself? Therefor
you can use e.g. the Whiteboard application in Teams or standalone.\
\
[Basic kata]{.underline} in this week (about 1 hour):\
Write down your identified contacts in a targeted and friendly manner
via the channels that seem suitable to you and refer briefly to your
first topic article and the rough topic plan.</p>
<p>If necessary take up suitable links and sources that connect you with
each other professionally and that the expert has already prepared
comprehensively or competently from your perspective.\
\
[Advanced video kata]{.underline} in this week (about 1 to 2 hours):\
Create a small video podcast episode in which you welcome your potential
ePortfolio visitors and describe your topic ideas audiovisually.</p>

<p><strong>\
</strong>[A) Exchange about the feedback of the contacts made so
far]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
In the last two weeks you have identified and contacted experts /
contacts for your topic. What have you learned? How much feedback did
you get? Have you gained new insights? Reflect in the group and ask each
other questions in order to run through your topic as deeply and
comprehensively as possible. You can use the following aspects to
structure your exchange:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My three top experts and their core aspects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listing of the most important partial aspects for my topic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This knowledge is (still) missing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[B) Refine topic ideas and vote on their relevance together in a
voting]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
Look together on the determined topic ideas of the past weeks. Give each
other a vote on which sub-area or facet is most relevant and should
therefore be tackled first or consciously at a later point. Each circle
member can give up to 3 points per idea.\
\
[C) Discuss ideas for topics together and put them in a first
order]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
By means of the voting system you can explain to each other why you have
given particularly many, few or no points for certain topics. From this
further discussion each of you can now draw valuable insights and
conclusions for your topics and how they fit into the plan in terms of
time and subject matter.\
\
[Basic kata]{.underline} for this week (about 1 hour):\
Refine the topics from the circle and create a reconsidered order for
the next week as an (editorial) plan. Begin with a first investigation
and elaboration for the next upcoming topic from your point of view.\
\
[Advanced kata]{.underline} for this week (about 1 hour):\
Think about questions that you could ask the community of your
ePortfolio in the context of your topic contributions and develop
further implementation ideas for the content of your future
contributions (e.g. for texts, infographics or short videos).</p>
<p>Your notes for exchange:</p>
<p>Week 11 - Promoting exchange</p>
<p>[D) Presentation of the previous revised topic plan]{.underline} |
(approx 25 minutes)\
On the basis of the past week you will now present your topic plans to
each other in the circle and also describe the basic considerations for
the order and different facets in more detail. If possible even mutual
topic plans can be created. Please also explain how the circle ranking
was taken into account in the voting process or why you consciously
decided against it.\
\
[E) Taking and giving feedback]{.underline} | (approx. 15 minutes)\
During or directly after the mutual presentation of the respective topic
plans give each other final feedback or additional tips on the various
topics. In this way you can ensure that your approach and planning is
perceived as meaningful and motivating by potential visitors to your
ePortfolio.\
\
[F) Encourage community exchange]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
Finally think together about which questions you could address to your
community as part of the topic contributions in order to promote the
exchange and further development of your topic. At the same time you can
also develop ideas for possible measures or accompanying actions that
support community feedback.\
\
[Basic kata]{.underline} for this week (about 1 hour):\
Create your preliminary finalized editorial plan for your topics of the
next months. Of course you can change it at any time if priorities for a
certain topic change but it should serve as an important guideline and
offer you orientation. Publish this plan or already a second post with
questions to your community, if you like.\
\
[Advanced video kata]{.underline} for this week (about 1 to 2 hours):\
Create a small video podcast episode in which you briefly introduce your
topic plan and describe special features / highlights and publish it in
your ePortfolio.</p>

<p><strong>Closing week 12\
</strong>[A) Brief instructions for feedback motivation and
reflection]{.underline} | (approx. 20 minutes)\
Today you start your final week - first of all, make a small change of
perspective: Try to put yourself in the position of one of your circle
members and think about why you should look at his / her ePortfolio from
his / her perspective. Which contents would you emphasize in particular?
Which added value for readers would you highlight? Perhaps also where do
you see connections to other ePortfolios from your circle? What
contents, contributions or discussions encourage you to leave feedback
in the ePortfolio? Exchange your views on this and mutually document any
helpful arguments that arise.\
\
[B) Continued exchange of topics and collecting ideas for community
expansion]{.underline} | (approx.15 minutes)\
Finally take some time to collect ideas or even topics that could be
especially helpful for further networking within and outside your
created ePortfolio community. Pu them on record together so that you can
begin again later on because your ePortfolio should and may of course be
continued. This will also strengthen a good feeling when you leave the
circle today.\
\
[C) Lessons learned: discuss successes and challenges as well as
possible next steps]{.underline} | (approx. 25 minutes)\
Now it is as far as it goes.After 12 weeks, the last round of the Circle
comes to an end and it is time to review these weeks again. At the end
you are welcome to discuss what you found to be the greatest insights,
surprises or challenges in managing your ePortfolio and exchanging
together with others.\</p>
<p>The following questions can serve as a guide:\
What do you take with you as decisive experiences / highlights from the
last weeks?\
What were the most important milestones / development steps for you?\
What did you miss out or was short-changed in the circle or in creating
the ePortfolio?\
What plans do you have for your ePortfolio and what do you want to
achieve next?\
Which activities or requirements might there be in the future to link
your ePortfolios with each other or even to continue together?\
\
[Basic kata]{.underline} to finish (about 1 hour):\
The final pitch: Try to present your ePortfolio elements and contents up
to this point in maximum 3 minutes. Try to highlight important portfolio
features that are relevant to the user and describe topic highlights
that you find special. Use the result for promoting your e-portfolio
(e.g. as a short video, infographics or text contribution).\
\
[Advanced video kata]{.underline} to finish (about 1 hour):\
Create a video podcast episode: \"A letter to myself\". This serves as a
retrospective for the whole circle: What and how have I learned in the
last weeks and what do I plan to do next? How have I progressed with my
topic overall? And thinking further ahead: What will my work on the
topic look like in the future with my ePortfolio?</p>
<p>Great, you have done it and successfully completed the learning path! We
hope that you were able to get to know and appreciate the ePortfolio
Learning method very well and that you will continue your ePortfolios in
the future. Therefor we wish you much fun and success!</p>
<p><strong>Last little \"extra task\" - celebrate your success!</strong></p>
<p>Ideally you will meet in the circle at the appropriate time for a small
event, e.g. dinner or something similar and celebrate what you have
achieved. You have spent a long time together investigating, creating
and discussing contents. You have established a relationship of trust
with each other that can be even more valuable than individual or joint
work on the ePortfolio and from which you will certainly benefit 😊</p>
<p>Herta, Marcel and Stefan are also looking forward to your feedback -
because we want to continuously develop and improve the ePortfolio
Learning Guide.</p>
<p>Many thanks for this already now!</p>
